The game idea is to predict the sentence that It's all characters are hidden like that `_ _ _ _ _ / _ _ _ _ _` for `hello world`. 

And you have only 9 tries to predict the sentence (Movie for example). 

And You have as seen in the above image a simple keyword that you can select the character from it and disable it once clicked.

Every Correct prediction will be affect all the occurences of the character in the sentence to be shown. For example if you press `l` key then the sentence will be converted to `_ _ l l _ / _ _ _ l _ ` for `hello world` sentence.

Every Wrong prediction will be added to the <strong>BlackList</strong> as seen on the above image until the wrong predictions reaches 9 you lose the game.

You win the game when you predict the sentence correctly and doesn't reach the 9 times of wrong predicts.
